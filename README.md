# pong🏓
The following pong game was built 3years ago (sept 2021) as part of my early journey in learning python programming the fun way. The credit must be given to youtube, since this game was totally developed based on youtube learning.

### Key-board control:
Player 1: W = up, S = down <br>
Player 2: ⬆️ = up ,  ⬇️ = down
